<h1 style="text-align: center; font-family: sans-serif; color: white; letter-spacing: 2.5px;">The early days</h1>
<p style="margin: 50px 10%; text-align: justify; color: white;

 Born on 9th of January 1971 in London, son of a Trinidadian mother and a Zimbabwean father, his family
 moved to the United States (Long Island, NY) when he was really young. Then, he started doing his first songs under the name
 <i>Zev Love X</i>. After a while in  he formed a group called <i>KMD</i> (acronym for Kausing Much Damage)
 with his brother (a.k.a. <i>DJ Subroc</i>) and <i>MC Rodan</i>.

They began their career by releasing Mr. Hood, a minor hit with its singles <i>"Peachfuzz", "Who Me?"</i> and airplay on both local
radio stations and even MTV. For the sophomore project, the group were going in a different direction, with harder, more abrasive
and socially charged songs, examplified by the artwork chosen for the album, which depicts a sambo character being hanged, with the title
being <i>Black Bastards</i>.

<p style="margin: 50px 10%; text-align: justify; color: white;
 font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 120%;">And it was that same cover that prevented the album from being released, with the discographic companies shelving it
 to try and avoid controversy. In what was a tragic week for Dumile, the group KMD ceased to exist,
 with the death of his brother in a traffic accident.</p>

 <p style="margin: 50px 10%; text-align: justify; color: white;
  font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 120%;">Due to the bad circumstances that he was going through, Dumile decided to retire from music, at least temporarily, in a hiatus that would extend from
 1993 to 1997. During those years he lived from small time jobs, but endured an overall very rough life, having to sleep on the streets and having barely any
future prospect.</p>
