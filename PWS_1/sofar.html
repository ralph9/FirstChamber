 Dumile followed his rise to fame (at least on an underground level) by collaborating with very different artists, not all of
 them belonging to the hip-hop world. His figure is still a mistery for most, giving few interviews over the years, and
 staying off the grid for the most part (so hard to reach that some of his colleagues have sometimes complained jokingly of how
 hard it is to be in contact with him). Nevertheless, that aura of mistery hasn't stopped him from releasing music and art projects
 at an constant rate, and maintaining a very high quality.

  font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 120%;">Among his most known collaborations are <i>Madvillainy</i>, a duo album with producer <i>Madlib</i>, considered by many one of the best hip-hop albums
 ever, and specially in the 21st century, due to its superb production and clever rhymes;
  <i>The Mouse and the Mask</i>, a record with producer Danger Mouse (the duo named themselves)
<i>DANGERDOOM</i>, a collaboration with <i>Gorillaz</i> in their album Demon Days (the track, <i>November Has Come</i>, became an instant hit), or with
renowned Australian group <i>The Avalanches</i> on their second album, <i>Wildflower.</i>
