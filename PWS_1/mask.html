 As time went on, Dumile starting getting back into the hip-hop underground community, performing freestyle at
 different open-mic events. But this time he came with a mask on, similar to the one that Marvel's villain Doctor
 Doom wore, and he started calling himself MF DOOM. An idea that was tried also during the same time by the French
 electronic duo Daft Punk, it proved to make
 the artists more enigmatic and helped them maintain a cult following while also keeping a low profile and
 maintaining most of their anonimity. Dumile followed the public appereances by the release of his first singles
 as MF DOOM,<i>"Dead Bent"</i>, <i>"Greenbacks"</i> and <i>"The M.I.C."</i>.

 Gaining traction and becoming even more popular on the underground scene, Dumile materialized the lyrical
and production efforts of the years before in his first LP, <i>"Operation: Doomsday"</i>, his first proper
piece of work, that included collaborations with prominent hip-hop figures from New York and abroad, and also
humorous skits that would pave the way for the dry wit that would be present on all of <i>Doom</i>'s
 work from then on. </p>
